###I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

###Comments:
I struggled with two main parts of this assignment. The first thing I struggled with was counting the number of times the header was clicked in the listener branch. If you click the header consecutively (such as a double click) the number of clicks will go up. However, if you click, wait a moment, and then click again the count resets to 1. I looked up documentation on this, but I was unable to understand a solution or other method. I am assuming this is because the event ends and restarts? I tried many different variations of functions using 1++ or + 1, but they ended up with elements undefined or null. The second thing I struggled with is how to end an event listener, such as reseting the image back to the original after the mouseenter event.
